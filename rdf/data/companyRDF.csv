Metrolink has provided a great career for me to showcase my management and customer service skills. I've been lucky enough to supervise not only up to 80 bus operators but now run my own building and Special Transit Service drivers for 10 years.
— TVM Ambassador  Los Angeles, CA

     MISSION, VISION & VALUES
OUR MISSION
Our mission is to provide safe, efficient, dependable and on-time transportation service that offers outstanding customer experience and enhances quality of life.
   OUR VISION
Our vision is to be Southern California’s preferred transportation system built upon safety, reliability, customer service, leading-edge technology and seamless connectivity.
   OUR VALUES
Safety: Safety is foundational.
People: Everything we do demonstrates an appreciation for the quality of life, and every act values the lives of our employees, contractor co-workers, customers, and communities.
Quality: We operate on best practices and principles with a continued focus on providing high-quality service to our customers every day on every ride.
Efficiency: As responsible stewards of public funds, we embrace innovative solutions and continuous improvement for the lowest cost and most efficient operations.
Growth: We continuously seek creative, progressive, and collaborative solutions to promote investment, develop partnerships, and increase capacity to improve the mobility of Southern Californians.
     Investing in a Cleaner Commute
Our commitment to environmental sustainability is reflected in the investments we make. Here are some of the many ways Metrolink has invested in a cleaner future for Southern California:
The New Tier 4. Metrolink is proud to become the first commuter rail system in the nation to operate new locomotives powered by Tier 4 clean technology. Tier 4 locomotives are the cleanest diesel locomotives in the nation and are up to 85% cleaner than our old locomotives. They have two-thirds more horsepower and are equipped with the latest safety upgrades.
Greater connectivity. Metrolink is the only transportation provider that serves the entire six-county area of Southern California. We also connect you to more free transfers and travel options, so you can leave your car at home or at the station. Your valid Metrolink fare connects you to city bus, shuttle bus, light rail, and subway lines, taking you farther than ever before. 
Bike trains and facilities. Metrolink promotes the use of bikes on our trains. Our fleet includes specialty Bike Cars that can hold up to 18 bikes, and most Metrolink stations offer bike racks or lockers for passengers. 
Electric vehicle recharging stations. Seventeen Metrolink stations are equipped with electric vehicle charging stations. 
Solar-paneled parking structures. In 2012, Metrolink’s Industry Station added 8,300 solar panels, creating a solar carport that generates up to 2.2 megawatts per hour while shading 940 parking spaces, the largest renewable energy project of its kind in Southern California. The station generates revenue for the city, and also provides 64 charging stalls for Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs).
Greener buildings. Our Dispatch and Operations Center (DOC) in Pomona has LEED Silver certification, conserving resources and promoting clean, renewable energy. 75% of its construction waste was recycled. It was built with 20% recycled material and uses 16% less energy with features like LED lighting. Building water use was reduced by 40%, and site water use by 50%, by using low flow devices and landscape treatments which allow for natural filtration. 
Sustainable Vehicles. Metrolink’s 182 support vehicles include electric, hybrid, low-emissions and flex-fuel varieties. As part of our replacement program, we are committed to procuring fuel-efficient vehicles that meet our needs without imposing an excessive environmental burden.
Corporate Partner Program. Employers and employees across Southern California receive tax incentives toward environmentally-friendly commutes in our Corporate Partner Program (CPP).

At XOR Security, we build solutions that keep our citizens safe, our government’s information secure and our intelligence professionals one step ahead of the adversary. From cybersecurity and data analytics to strategic consulting and cloud services, the XOR team provides the insight, expertise and dedication to ensure mission success. Our solutions deliver certainty – the certainty you need to make critical decisions and lead with confidence.
Who We Are
What makes the XOR team different is our ability to articulate critical details with precision and clarity. Too often technology experts are unable to effectively communicate key details of a solution, system or threat to a non-technical decision maker. At XOR, we’re not only subject matter experts, we’re expert communicators. Through this, our clients gain a deeper understanding of health and risks to their enterprise, and of their adversary’s tools, techniques and processes. Better information, clearly presented, leads to better decisions.
What We Offer
At XOR, we’re cyber warriors by practice, and data scientists by design. Our core expertise aligns with strategic needs clients in government and the commercial sector face every day. We’ve built our team of experts with your mission in mind. Our expertise includes:
