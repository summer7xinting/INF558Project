174,174,UAT Onboard Notifications,"<p>THIS IS TEST JOB 1</p><p>NOT FOR HIRING</p><p> </p><p>The <em>Jabberwocky Effect</em></p><p>In <strong>2010, t</strong>here was a short-lived but memorable U.S. TV series called <em>Better Off Ted</em>. The show is a silly workplace comedy that lampoons corporate culture to a hyperbolic extent. But one episode, <em>Jabberwocky</em> (Season 1 Episode 12), captures the corporate buzzword effect too accurately.</p><p>Ted, the lead character, tries to hide budget for a pet project. When his boss Veronica confronts him, he lies and says the funds went to the revolutionary “Jabberwocky” project, which he vaguely makes up on the spot.</p><p>Here’s the funny part though. Rather than clarify what “Jabberwocky” is, Veronica pretends to be “in the know” fearing to look incompetent for being out of the loop. She pushes the nonexistent Jabberwocky project as top priority on the rest of the company. With hilarious results, every leader and employee works on Jabberwocky having no idea what it is, but would never dare admit their ignorance to each other.</p><p>Blindsided by how far it escalated, Ted comes clean to Veronica right before they do a keynote on “Jabberwocky”. Veronica tells Ted to proceed anyway because “products are for people who don’t have presentations”.</p><p>Many believed an algorithm would transcend humanity with cognitive awareness. Machines would discern and learn tasks without human intervention and replace workers in droves. They quite literally would be able to “think”. Many people even raised the question whether we could have robots for spouses.</p><p>But I am not talking about today. What if I told you this idea was widely marketed in the 1960’s, and AI pioneers Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, and Claude Shannon insisted this could happen in their near future? If you find this surprising, watch this video and be amazed how familiar these sentiments are.</p><p>Fast forward to 1973, and the hype and exaggeration of AI backfired. The U.K. Parliament sent Sir James Lighthill to get a status report of A.I. research in the U.K. The report criticized the failure of artificial intelligence research to live up to its sensational claims. Interestingly, Lighthill also pointed out how specialized programs (or people) performed better than their “AI” counterparts, and had no prospects in real-world environments. Consequently, AI research funding was slashed by the British government.</p><p>I probably do not have to explain the analogy that is “Jabberwocky”. Replace that word with “Blockchain”, “Big Data”, “Bitcoin”, “Artificial Intelligence”, “Internet of Things”, “Quantum Computing”, “Machine Learning”, or “Data Science” and you know exactly what I mean. Corporate culture has long had a history of hyping innovations and people pretending to understand them, only to encounter their limits and chase something else.</p><p>Now that I have highlighted the “Jabberwocky Effect”, let’s continue.</p><p>A Brief History of Data Science</p><p>If you want to define “data science” as anything that has to do with “data”, you can go back to the dawn of computing. If you think math and statistics are crucial to data science just as much as data, you could go centuries back and say statisticians were the original “data scientists”.</p><p>For the sake of brevity, let’s go to the 1990’s. Things used to be pretty simple. Analysts, statisticians, researchers, and data engineers were all pretty separate roles with occasional overlap. Tooling stacks often consisted of spreadsheets, R, MATLAB, SAS, and/or SQL.</p><p>Of course throughout the 2000’s things were changing. Google pushed data collection and analytics to unimaginable heights. In 2009, Google executives insisted statisticians will have the “sexiest job” for the next 10 years. That was a decade ago, but I recall that being a strange sentiment. But lo and behold, in 2011 “Harvard Business Review” mainstreamed this concept called “data science” and declared it the sexiest job of the 21st century.</p><p>It was at that moment the craze started in “Jabberwocky” fashion. Harvard created a void called “data science” and everyone raced to fill it. SQL developers, analysts, researchers, quants, statisticians, physicists, biologists, and a myriad of other professionals rebranded themselves as “data science” professionals. Silicon Valley companies, feeling that traditional role titles like “analyst” or “researcher” sounded too limited, renamed the roles to “data scientist” which sounded more empowered and impactful.</p><p> </p><p>Outside Silicon Valley, this added to the confusion as most folks think of “scientists” as PhD’s in white lab coats. Counter-intuitively, data scientists actually come from many backgrounds (technical and nontechnical) with varying levels of education (BS, BA, MBA, and <em>sometimes</em> PhDs). Many hiring managers, HR departments, and organizations in general struggled to define what they needed in a data scientist, which is why many of you probably have sad anecdotes about a young data scientist getting thrown a MySQL database, but was unable to do anything meaningful with it.</p><p>Throw in scaling advancements in data engineering (think “big data”), as well as the rapid advancements of “machine learning”, then the “data science” umbrella gets larger and more vague. More buzzwords are thrown around that many people are saying and yet few understand. Before you know it, “big data” and “machine learning” have become synonymous, and distinction of disciplines becomes lost.</p><p>Even worse, companies make uninformed decisions and think they need data science skill “X"" (e.g. deep learning) to solve an everyday problem like scheduling, when in fact they need an operations research person who knows search algorithms. What’s hot and current is not the best solution for most problems, and this can be a costly mistake.

208,208,Data Engineer,"Position Summary

Client is looking to fill the full-time position of a data engineer. This position covers all business units and countries in which Client operates.

The data engineer, which is an emerging role in Client data and analytics team, will play a pivotal role in operationalizing the most-urgent data and analytics initiatives for Client digital business initiatives. The bulk of the data engineer’s work would be in building, managing and optimizing data pipelines and then moving these data pipelines effectively into production for key data and analytics consumers (like business/data analysts, data scientists or any persona that needs curated data for data and analytics use cases).

Data engineers also need to guarantee compliance with data governance and data security requirements while creating, improving and operationalizing these integrated and reusable data pipelines. This would enable faster data access, integrated data reuse and vastly improved time-to-solution for all data and analytics initiatives.

The newly hired data engineer will be the key interface in operationalizing data and analytics on behalf of the business units and organizational outcomes. This role will require both creative and collaborative working with IT and the wider business. It will involve evangelizing effective data management practices and promoting better understanding of data and analytics. The data engineer will also be tasked with working with key business stakeholders, IT experts and subject-matter experts to plan and deliver optimal analytics and data science solutions.

Additionally, data engineers will also be expected to collaborate with data scientists, data analysts and other data consumers and work on the models and algorithms developed by them in order to optimize them for data quality, security and governance and put them into production leading to potentially large productivity gains.

Responsibilities and Activities
Build data pipelines: Managed data pipelines consist of a series of stages through which data flows (for example, from data sources or endpoints of acquisition to integration to consumption for specific use cases). These data pipelines have to be created, maintained and optimized as workloads move from development to production for specific use cases. Architecting, creating and maintaining data pipelines will be the primary responsibility of the data engineer.
Drive Automation through effective metadata management: The data engineer will be responsible for using innovative and modern tools, techniques and architectures to partially or completely automate the most-common, repeatable and tedious data preparation and integration tasks in order to minimize manual and error-prone processes and improve productivity. The data engineer will also need to assist with renovating the data management infrastructure to drive automation in data integration and management.

This will include (but not be limited to):
Learning and using modern data preparation, integration and AI-enabled metadata management tools and techniques.
Tracking data consumption patterns.
Performing intelligent sampling and caching.
Monitoring schema changes.
Recommending — or sometimes even automating — existing and future integration flows.
Collaborate across departments: The newly hired data engineer will need strong collaboration skills in order to work with varied stakeholders within the organization. In particular, the data engineer will work in close relationship with data science teams and with business (data) analysts in refining their data requirements for various data and analytics initiatives and their data consumption requirements.
Educate and train: The data engineer should be curious and knowledgeable about new data initiatives and how to address them. This includes applying their data and/or domain understanding in addressing new data requirements. They will also be responsible for proposing appropriate (and innovative) data ingestion, preparation, integration and operationalization techniques in optimally addressing these data requirements. The data engineer will be required to train counterparts such as data scientists, data analysts, LOB users or any data consumers in these data pipelining and preparation techniques, which make it easier for them to integrate and consume the data they need for their own use cases.
Participate in ensuring compliance and governance during data use: It will be the responsibility of the data engineer to ensure that the data users and consumers use the data provisioned to them responsibly through data governance and compliance initiatives. Data engineers should work with data governance teams (and information stewards within these teams) and participate in vetting and promoting content created in the business and by data scientists to the curated data catalog for governed reuse.
Become a data and analytics evangelist: The data engineer will be considered a blend of data and analytics “evangelist,” “data guru” and “fixer.” This role will promote the available data and analytics capabilities and expertise to business unit leaders and educate them in leveraging these capabilities in achieving their business goals.

Key Requirements
A successful candidate will have the expertise and skills described below.

Education and Training
A bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, statistics, applied mathematics, data management, information systems, information science or a related quantitative field (or equivalent work experience) is required.

Strong experience in working with large, heterogeneous datasets in building and optimizing data pipelines, pipeline architectures and integrated datasets using traditional data integration technologies. These should include ETL/ELT, data replication/CDC, message-oriented data movement, API design and access and upcoming data ingestion and integration technologies such as stream data integration, CEP and data virtualization.
Strong experience in working with and optimizing existing ETL processes and data integration and data preparation flows and helping to move them in production.
Basic understanding in working with both open-source and commercial message queuing technologies (such as Kafka, JMS, Azure Service Bus, Amazon Simple queuing Service), stream data integration technologies (such as Apache Nifi, Apache Beam, Apache Kafka Streams, Amazon Kinesis) and stream analytics technologies (such as Apache Kafka KSQL Apache Spark Streaming Apache Samza).
