We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers – you know – GEEK OUT. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.


Clarity Insights is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. We believe in treating each employee and applicant for employment fairly and with dignity.

The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity


Our work in education is aimed at ensuring that every student — not just a lucky few — can get an education that's tailored to their individual needs and supports every aspect of their development. We're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there. An example of the work CZI's education team supports include the Summit Learning Program, a personalized approach to teaching and learning that enhances the quality of student-teacher interactions and empowers educators to tailor instruction to individual student needs.

Our Education Data Science team is responsible for measuring and evaluating product and program changes. For example, how product impacts student performance on cognitive skills, how schools onboard onto the program or how professional development impacts on onboarding, etc. This team defines measurements, product metrics, provides product insights through analysis, recommends what to improve and build next, as well as collaborates and communicates with the cross-functional and leadership teams.

As a Data Scientist with a Product focus, you will build metrics, visualizations, dashboards, provide data insight, product expertise, and a strategic perspective to partners throughout the organization. You will combine your deep knowledge of the product and user behavior with quantitative analysis to tell meaningful stories that inform team decisions. You will collaborate closely with your colleagues in Engineering, Product Management, User Experience Research and Product Design. You will understand the ins and outs of the product and database and you will be looked to as an expert across the team.

You will
Conduct data analysis to make product recommendations
Deliver effective presentations of findings and recommendations to stakeholders, creating visual displays of quantitative information

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?

We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers – you know – GEEK OUT. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together.

Equity is a fundamental pillar to the society we seek to build. The process of advancing toward equity will be disruptive and demands vigilance, dismantling deeply entrenched systems of privilege and oppression.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

Some of the problems you will solve entail understanding data, identifying patterns, quantifying the impact of ML / NLP models and designing data visualizations. We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers and product managers, you’ll have the freedom to make key product decisions without much oversight, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment, with the opportunity to have more control and leadership; in a company with thousands of existing customers.

Image recognition is no longer an innovation to you, instead it is a routine task.
NLP isn’t a foreign acronym and you’ve gone from strings to whiskers.
You sail smooth in Python and always have sklearn, tensorflow, keras and pytorch on deck.
K-means more than a curt text and Logit and Probit are not Hobbit characters.
You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.
Minimum Qualifications
Degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, statistics, data science or a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
3 years of work experience in data science or related field.

We all know someone who’s been affected by cancer, and we’ve proven that our technology can help get life-saving treatments to patients faster (https://people.com/health/teacher-brain-tumor-week-to-live-now-thriving/). Having already signed a set of Fortune 500 paying clients, we’re ramping up for our next phase of growth and are looking for a bold and self-motivated researcher to join us as we change healthcare for the better.

More about us:

Currently developing a single new drug can take over $1B and 15 years, with over 99% of drugs failing along the way. This is why over 70% of all known diseases have no treatments and millions of patients are left with no viable treatment options.

At OneThree Biotech we’re working to change this using biology-driven AI. Founded after members of our team lost family members to rare cancer, the team at OneThree has spent the last 5+ years researching how we can combine AI with systems biology to stop this from happening to anyone else. We’re building a platform to not only predict new potential therapeutics, but also to pinpoint the mechanisms driving efficacy, and we pride ourselves on building a new form of biology-driven AI that values interpretability as much as accuracy. After raising a multi-million round of funding, we’re looking for a Senior Computational Biologist to join our interdisciplinary team as we look to ramp up external partnerships and internal development.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:

Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences.

SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.
