We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

About RMS

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

In May 2019, we announced RMS Risk Intelligence™ (RI), an open-standard platform for strategic risk management. Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.

How we understand and manage risk affects everyone and our passion is nothing less than creating a more resilient world through a better understanding of catastrophic events.

The system is designated as the DODs Joint Frequency Assignment system, and it has been in use operationally at the DOD since 1999. The system provides a suite of tools and workflow automation to process frequency requests and manage use of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., radio frequencies).

The SXXI/MSXXI application is a client/server, Windows-based software system that provides frequency managers with a single information system to address spectrum management automation requirements. SXXI supports operational planning and management of the radio frequency spectrum with an emphasis on assigning compatible frequencies and performing spectrum engineering tasks. SXXI is the Joint standard system for spectrum management throughout the DOD. It has also been adopted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for processing frequency records for federal agencies. SPECTRUM XXI was also provided to over 22 foreign nations through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and these efforts have paid off with SPECTRUM XXI being used by all NATO International Security Assistance Forces spectrum management elements in the Afghan Area of Operations. SXXI interoperates with the NTIA Federal Spectrum Management System and any system that complies with the Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) frequency record data standard. No existing Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system or other Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) system meets SXXI system requirements.

While domain knowledge related to RF systems and/or spectrum management is a plus, a candidate with strong software systems engineering capability in some/many of the preferred skill sets is the primary need for this effort. .

Throughout our history, we have worked extensively on a wide variety of cutting-edge communications systems ranging from satellites to terrestrial networks to high-altitude platforms.

The candidate selected will be working an extensive and comprehensive modernization of the legacy SPECTRUM XXI (SXXI) system in terms of engineering capability, UI/UX, and utility for Federal users. SXXI is, and its modernized version (MSXXI) will be, a mission critical National Security System (NSS) used by the Department of Defense (DOD), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), other U.S. Federal Agencies, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and foreign allies for strategic and tactical operations. The system is designated as the DODs Joint Frequency Assignment system, and it has been in use operationally at the DOD since 1999. The system provides a suite of tools and workflow automation to process frequency requests and manage use of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., radio frequencies).

The SXXI/MSXXI application is a client/server, Windows-based software system that provides frequency managers with a single information system to address spectrum management automation requirements. SXXI supports operational planning and management of the radio frequency spectrum with an emphasis on assigning compatible frequencies and performing spectrum engineering tasks. SXXI is the Joint standard system for spectrum management throughout the DOD. It has also been adopted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for processing frequency records for federal agencies. SPECTRUM XXI was also provided to over 22 foreign nations through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and these efforts have paid off with SPECTRUM XXI being used by all NATO International Security Assistance Forces spectrum management elements in the Afghan Area of Operations. SXXI interoperates with the NTIA Federal Spectrum Management System and any system that complies with the Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) frequency record data standard. No existing Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system or other Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) system meets SXXI system requirements.

About RMS

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

About AVB Marketing:

It all started on a fishing boat…no, really. In the spring of 1969, on a small fishing boat in southern California, a few appliance and electronics retailers debated the possibility of pooling their purchase orders, so they could buy product for less and increase profitability. That summer, Associated Volume Buyers (AVB) was born. Fast forward to present day, we have more than $17 Billion, with a capital B, in annual retail sales, over 4,500 independent members and over 8,000 stores in North America. We are member-owned, not-for-profit, the fastest growing membership of our kind and a force to be reckoned with. For us, it’s all about the members! Their growth and profitability is our passion and we pursue every opportunity to help make this ever changing and competitive business more rewarding.

We are a quick-moving, forward-thinking, industry leader - in other words, we are doing big things. We are excited to learn from you, and for you to learn from us.

We offer a very competitive compensation package including excellent medical, dental, life, vision, EAP, FSA Accounts, 401(k) Plan, paid vacation, sick leave and holidays.

If you want to work for an innovative company that is growing and values their employees, we encourage you to apply.

About RMS

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

RMS helped pioneer the natural catastrophe model market we now lead – and we continue to innovate. In May 2019, we announced RMS Risk Intelligence™ (RI), an open-standard platform for strategic risk management. Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.

How we understand and manage risk affects everyone and our passion is nothing less than creating a more resilient world through a better understanding of catastrophic events.

Fast forward to present day, we have more than $17 Billion, with a capital B, in annual retail sales, over 4,500 independent members and over 8,000 stores in North America. We are member-owned, not-for-profit, the fastest growing membership of our kind and a force to be reckoned with. For us, it’s all about the members!
