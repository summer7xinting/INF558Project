You’ll get the opportunity to work on APIs that multiple people depend on both internally and externally to Atlassian and an AWS based platform which uses technologies like Elasticsearch and DynamoDB. We are a team with very little legacy in our tech stack and as a result you’ll spend less time paying off technical debt and more time identifying ways to make our platform better and improve our users experience.

You enjoy working in a fast paced environment and you are able to take vague requirements and transform them into solid solutions.

On your first day, we'll expect you to have:

• At least 2 years professional experience as a software engineer or data engineer
• A BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience
• Strong programming skills (some combination of Python, and Node.js preferred)
• Experience building platforms, micro services, and REST APIs
• Experience with ElasticSearch, DynamoDB, and other technologies to process incredible volumes of streaming data
• Experience writing GraphQL, structuring data, and data storage practices
• A willingness to accept failure, learn and try again and an open mind to try solutions that may seem crazy at first
• Experience working on Amazon Web Services (in particular using S3, SQS and the like)

It's preferred, but not technically required, that you have:

• Experience building self-service tooling and platforms
• A passion for building and running continuous integration pipelines.

More about the team

Data is a BIG deal at Atlassian. We ingest over 180 billion events each month into our real-time platform and we have dozens of teams across the company depending on the speed and data the platform provides.
You’ll be joining a strong team that is spread out among multiple Atlassian locations. We value when people ask hard questions and challenge each other to constantly improve our work. We are independent but love highly collaborative team environments, so you'll get the opportunity to work with lots of other awesome people just like you!
More about our benefits

Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, flexible working options, five paid volunteer days a year for your favourite cause, an annual allowance to support your learning & growth, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years and lots more.

More about Atlassian

Creating software that empowers everyone from small startups to the who’s who of tech is why we’re here.

"FarApp
4.2",-1,2002,"Torrance, CA",Enterprise Software & Network Solutions,"Job Description
Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus
We're recruiting for applicants at levels of experience who are passionate about solving problems.

AWS - EC2 - Amazon,-1,-1,-1,-1,"Summary

EC2, a part of Amazon Web Services, is a fast-growing business within Amazon that provides cost effective easy to use cloud computing resources to businesses of all sizes around the world. With AWS, you can requisition compute power, storage, databases, and many other services paying as you go for only the resources you need.

Who we are: Our team owns a few services that enable every EC2 instance launch. We are responsible for making the decision on every launch request if the launch can move forward or not. This covers both protecting EC2 from things like fraud and making sure no single customer impacts other customers' experiences. We support every call to the EC2 RunInstances API, we handle other APIs as well. We also assist services that run on top of EC2 protect their user experiences like Lightsail, Fargate, and Workspaces.

What you will do: You will be a technical leader on the team that runs our tier1 service that tracks the state of our capacity in real-time. This team is a newly formed team that is not fully staffed yet and is just launching v1 of the service. The team owns mission-critical software that ensures EC2's business can run each and every day. The service acts as the source of truth for capacity health and account usage data. The landscape of the business is constantly changing one day you may be working on scaling the API that lets customers see their account usage, the next drafting a proposal to build a new pool health distribution mechanism for our launch path services, or if you get bored you can work with our embedded research team to build the new account metadata calculation engine using statistical models and ML.

Why it matters: EC2, while a mature business, is still growing at an incredibly fast rate with new regions launching every few months. EC2 Capacity Management sits at the heart of EC2, all roads lead to capacity and the systems that support distributing it. Our team, being central to running EC2, gets the opportunity to interact with teams across AWS and Amazon in general, we are the capacity experts. If a major product launch is happening or customer has a complex use case, we are probably involved.

Why youll love it: EC2 is growing so fast we are still in startup mode and there is plenty of space to innovate and grow, only the hard problems still exist. You will have ownership, not just responsibility; it will be up to you to identify the top problems and prioritize the solutions that will give the most business impact. This is a fast growing team in which the business continues to invest, the team has grown and split multiple times.

Who we're looking for: Natural technical leaders that show up to work to get things done and love building systems at scale.

AWS - EC2 - Amazon,-1,1935,"Gonzales, LA","Cable, Internet & Telephone Providers","Summary

EC2, a part of Amazon Web Services, is a fast-growing business within Amazon that provides cost effective easy to use cloud computing resources to businesses of all sizes around the world. With AWS, you can requisition compute power, storage, databases, and many other services paying as you go for only the resources you need.

Who we are: Our team owns a few services that enable every EC2 instance launch. We are responsible for making the decision on every launch request if the launch can move forward or not. This covers both protecting EC2 from things like fraud and making sure no single customer impacts other customers' experiences. We support every call to the EC2 RunInstances API, we handle other APIs as well. We also assist services that run on top of EC2 protect their user experiences like Lightsail, Fargate, and Workspaces.

What you will do: You will be a technical leader on the team that runs our tier1 service that tracks the state of our capacity in real-time. This team is a newly formed team that is not fully staffed yet and is just launching v1 of the service. The team owns mission-critical software that ensures EC2's business can run each and every day. The service acts as the source of truth for capacity health and account usage data. The landscape of the business is constantly changing one day you may be working on scaling the API that lets customers see their account usage, the next drafting a proposal to build a new pool health distribution mechanism for our launch path services, or if you get bored you can work with our embedded research team to build the new account metadata calculation engine using statistical models and ML.

Why it matters: EC2, while a mature business, is still growing at an incredibly fast rate with new regions launching every few months. EC2 Capacity Management sits at the heart of EC2, all roads lead to capacity and the systems that support distributing it. Our team, being central to running EC2, gets the opportunity to interact with teams across AWS and Amazon in general, we are the capacity experts. If a major product launch is happening or customer has a complex use case, we are probably involved.

Why youll love it: EC2 is growing so fast we are still in startup mode and there is plenty of space to innovate and grow, only the hard problems still exist. You will have ownership, not just responsibility; it will be up to you to identify the top problems and prioritize the solutions that will give the most business impact. This is a fast growing team in which the business continues to invest, the team has grown and split multiple times.

Who we're looking for: Natural technical leaders that show up to work to get things done and love building systems at scale. You will need to be able to dive deep and ensure the right operational processes are in place and that we are designing software that can scale to the business needs. Being able to set a technical vision and inspire a dev team to deliver is critical. Ideally, you are a seasoned Senior Developer looking to grow and take on the next challenge.

If this sounds intriguing consider joining our team. You will enjoy a very competitive salary, great benefits, a work environment with an innovation culture, and exciting opportunities to make history, have great fun and be part of the fastest-growing technology company on earth.

"Leadr, Inc",-1,-1,"Los Angeles, CA",-1,"What makes this job meaningful?

The workplace has changed. Today’s employees expect more than just pay or title, they seek careers where they can learn, grow, be challenged, and be valued for the ideas they bring to the table.

Unfortunately, most organizations lack the tools and structure needed to create this kind of coaching and development culture across every team and every manager. Instead, their development efforts are buried in disconnected systems or compliance-based HR software.

When you join Leadr, you’ll be helping us to solve this incredibly complex, yet worthwhile, puzzle of one to one people development at scale within organizations.

Leadr exists to help every manager become a coach and give every employee a voice and you will play a crucial role in turning this vision into reality.

Our development team at Leadr gets to pioneer this vision through building our world-class product and the systems to support it. We take feedback from our team and customers to create a roadmap to build.

Why You’ll Be Motivated To Apply…
You’ve mastered the basic skills of software engineering and need a new challenge. Your code is tidy and approaching an art form, your solutions are precisely architected to consider scalability, reliability, monitoring, security, automated testing, maintainability and all that.
At this stage in your career you want to be asked to solve problems, rather than “told what to do”.
You’re excited by our tech stack and know that it presents both an opportunity for you dazzle us with your current skills but also stretch and grow.
Leadr is an early stage startup and with that comes amazing growth opportunities. Most likely you’ve only worked at large mature bureaucratic companies or small companies that aren’t really growing. Leadr is neither of those things. You are going to stretch so much you’ll wish you were made out of nylon.
Leadr is doing something radical and exciting. You noticed that when you checked out our website.
Whatever happens in the economy, Leadr is a solid financial position. We are startup, but we have 24 months of runway and we believe our product is needed now more than ever.
Why We Need You …
As we are coming out of beta we are looking to speed-up, not slow-down. During the beta phase it was ok to deploy buzy builds to production every 2 weeks but going forward we need a more sophisticated build pipeline. Our goal is to have production updated multiple times per day. Safely!
We are transitioning to having vertically-integrated development teams where the devs, the QA and the product people are all working together in the same location (although under the current circumstances we're just happy to have everyone in the same timezone! We're all working remotely until things settle down).
You will enable us to ship value faster and more frequently without breaking things or disrupting users.
Requirements

Our Tech Stack:

At a high level our tech stack is a React frontend on top of a microservice backend implemented as NodeJS AWS Lambdas with data stored in DGraph, a graph DB. Terraform, NightwatchJS and Jenkins are all part of the magic that gets features into production. We're currently developing iOS and Android companions apps.

Our SDLC and Deployment Process:

Our team works in 2 week sprints and follows an Agile-ish approach. We are enthusiastic about test automation and TDD, we have pretty good unit test coverage and we're expanding on that to build integration level testing too. We are utilising Feature Flags and we're putting in place all the infrastructure we need to support safely and reliably deploying code to production several times per day.

You Will Be Well Set To CRUSH This Role If...
You have 5+ years of experience building web applications, especially SasS applications.
To be considered for this vital role you need to have prior experience of software engineering on a B2B or B2C Saas product that was a ""daily-use"" type of application, with a SDLC that closely matches what we are striving towards. In that role you were an integral part of successfully and reliably deploying updates to production on a daily basis.
Experience with feature flags is a huge bonus.
Experience with frontend frameworks like React or Angular
You can devise engineering solutions by considering multiple options and then present the pros/cons including cost, effort, complexity, scalability, maintainability etc as part of your proposal and then walk others through your decision matrix.
Familiarity with a diverse range of datastore systems, especially Graph databases and traversal algorithms.
You are no stranger to test automation, in fact you are reluctant to call something Code Complete unless it has decent test coverage.
You’ve been part of a team that deploys commercial web apps built on cloud-native technologies through full CI/CD controlled environments.
Experience with building infrastructure-as-code, managing code + pipelines, Kubernetes and/or Docker are going to be a huge help.
You are passionate about what you do, you are a motivated self-starter and always learning and developing.
Given a complex 3-month long body of work you would be able to break that down into work units, estimate accurately, plan the work and execute it precisely within the expectations you’ve set with your team. You know you can do this because you’ve done it before.
Location

This role reports to the Head of Product & Engineering (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonglover/)

When life goes back to normal this role will be located at our offices in Plano, Texas. Until we know what normal looks like this is a remote job.

Benefits

We are pleased to offer competitive salary, bonuses, and benefits. We offer PTO, Paid Holidays, Flex Holidays, etc. We are committed to developing you as a leader and providing career growth throughout your employment with us.

What can you expect for your interview process?

While not all candidates will complete the entire process, here’s what it looks like from start to finish. We’ll keep communication open the entire way so you always know where you stand.
Complete the Kick-Off Interview Form, which is part of the Application Process. We take your answers very seriously and will reference them throughout the interview process.
We promise we won’t make you retype your resume into another form, we value your time.
A 30-45 minute Culture Interview either by video call or in-person.
We’ll use this time to simply get to know you as a person and hear more about your story.
A 60-minute Technical Screen either by video call or in-person.
We’ll use this time to make sure possess the minimum skills we think are required to accomplish the key objectives.
3-4 hour meet & greet with the broader team, plus a more in-depth Technical Interview. This can be done either by video call or in-person. We’ll dig into how you would go about accomplishing the objectives we shared for the role and your past experience doing similar work.
And finally, the Offer letter is sent. Welcome to the team!
About Leadr

While the problem we’re tackling at Leadr is ambitious, we have reason to be optimistic:
Our early team is loaded with talented and experienced people who share a passion for the mission
The executive team has done this before, founding and leading a startup in the payments space to hypergrowth and a successful exit in less than 10 years

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We remain committed to putting our people, customers, and communities first and appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work through this.
The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
Your role:
We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer in Test to help our team design, build, and implement a robust testing strategy for our credentialing platform. In this hybrid role you should think of yourself as both a developer and developer advocate for all things QUALITY related.

You are a mentor to others. You are comfortable performing code reviews, pair programming with other developers, and giving brown bag presentations on quality related topics.
You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and TESTABLE. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
You don’t reinvent the wheel every time you build something new.
You can explain complex ideas in plain and simple language (most of the time).
Your qualifications:
5+ years of experience working with production systems. Must understand concepts such as multi-tier architecture, microservices, databases, and statelessness.
Professional experience writing testable code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Should be comfortable with multiple test development processes such as TDD, BDD, DDD, ATDD. Familiarity with defensive coding practices is a must!
Professional experience working with testing frameworks such as Jasmine/Jest and Selenium/Cypress.io.
Experience debugging code.
Experience implementing automated testing into CI/CD pipelines.
Experience with container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.
Experience designing and building APIs.
Experience working on a scrum team in an agile environment.

The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
Your role:
We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer in Test to help our team design, build, and implement a robust testing strategy for our credentialing platform.

You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and TESTABLE. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
You don’t reinvent the wheel every time you build something new.
You can explain complex ideas in plain and simple language (most of the time).
Your qualifications:
5+ years of experience working with production systems. Must understand concepts such as multi-tier architecture, microservices, databases, and statelessness.
Professional experience writing testable code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Should be comfortable with multiple test development processes such as TDD, BDD, DDD, ATDD. Familiarity with defensive coding practices is a must!

We are also one of the most active participants in defining cable related industry standards in collaboration with CableLabs.

Our Cable team is currently responsible for the architecture, and the design and development of the next generation cloud-based CMTS product called cnBR. This system is built around most commonly utilized cloud native open source-based components (Microservices, Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Cassandra, ETCD, etc). It is designed to run on a generic server platform running Linux Host OS (i.e., Cisco UCS servers). The design and development effort encompass building the infrastructure, orchestration, automation, telemetry / health monitoring, including CMTS L2 DOCSIS layer control and data plane for real-time performance which adheres to the industry specifications.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
